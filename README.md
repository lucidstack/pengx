# Pengx

Pure Elixir PNG encoding library with no dependencies.

Status: not even close to doing anything. Hacking on bits and pieces of code.

Why: Because I was bored and it seemed like a good idea, and I wanted a way to
write PNGs for another project I'm thinking of writing, and realised that I
should totally write that library as well.
